# 📘 Day 9: Flashcard Learning App

A simple and interactive Flashcard Learning App built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of the “20 Days 20 Projects Challenge” and focuses on strengthening frontend fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, CSS 3D animations, event handling, and LocalStorage.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This Flashcard Learning App allows users to create, flip, and study flashcards directly in the browser. Each flashcard contains a question on the front side and an answer on the back side, with a smooth 3D flip animation. All flashcards are stored permanently using the browser’s LocalStorage, so data is not lost even after refreshing the page.

- Flip cards with smooth CSS 3D animation (front ↔ back)  
- Reveal answer instantly using a button  
- Edit and delete existing flashcards  
- Preserve spaces and new lines exactly as typed  
- Data persistence using LocalStorage  
- Import flashcards from a JSON file  
- Export flashcards as a JSON file
